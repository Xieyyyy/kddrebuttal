# Supplementary experiments

The anonymous repository is built for showing the supplementary experiments during the 
rebuttal and response period of paper "LAMEE: A Light All-MLP Framework Leveraging Joint Time-Frequency Information for 
Time Series Prediction" (paper id 191) in SIGKDD 2023.

Sperifically, we conduct three types of supplementary experiments:
> E1: Supplementary performance comparisons.
> E2: Supplementary effeciency comparisons.
> E3: A visualization for comparison between high-dimensional embeddings and raw features.
