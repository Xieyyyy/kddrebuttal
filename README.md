# Supplementary experiments

## Introduction

The anonymous repository is built for showing the supplementary experiments during the 
rebuttal and response period of paper "LAMEE: A Light All-MLP Framework Leveraging Joint Time-Frequency Information for 
Time Series Prediction" (paper id 191) in SIGKDD 2023.

Sperifically, we conduct three types of supplementary experiments:
> E1: Supplementary performance comparisons.

> E2: Supplementary effeciency comparisons.

> E3: A visualization for comparison between high-dimensional embeddings and raw features.


## Supplementary performance comparisons

We have utilized a fair third party benchmark that is publicly accessible ([link](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library)) to compare 14 influential time series forecasting 
studies that has been presented in recent years on 9 datasets (8 of which are public). We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the 
authors of this benchmark.

These compared studies are:
> 1. Connecting the Dots: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks. KDD, 2020. ([paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3394486.3403118)) ([code](https://github.com/nnzhan/MTGNN))

> 2. Enhancing the locality and breaking the memory bottleneck of transformer on time series forecasting. NeurIPS, 2019. ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00235.pdf))

> 3. Neural Jump Ordinary Differential Equations: Consistent Continuous-Time Prediction and Filtering. ICLR, 2021. ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04727.pdf)) ([code](https://github.com/HerreraKrachTeichmann/NJODE))

> 4. Informer: Beyond efficient transformer for long sequence time-series forecasting. AAAI, 2021. ([paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17325))
