# Supplementary experiments

## Introduction

The anonymous repository is built for showing the supplementary experiments during the 
rebuttal and response period of paper "LAMEE: A Light All-MLP Framework Leveraging Joint Time-Frequency Information for 
Time Series Prediction" (paper id 191) in SIGKDD 2023.

Sperifically, we conduct three types of supplementary experiments:
> E1: Supplementary performance comparisons.

> E2: Supplementary effeciency comparisons.

> E3: A visualization for comparison between high-dimensional embeddings and raw features.


## Supplementary performance comparisons

We have utilized a fair third party benchmark that is publicly accessible ([link](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library)) to compare 14 influential time series forecasting 
studies that has been presented in recent years on 9 datasets (8 of which are public). We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the 
authors of this benchmark.

These compared studies are:
